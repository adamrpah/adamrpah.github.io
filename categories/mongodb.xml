I guess my post on &lt;a src="http://www.npcompleteheart.com/posts/things-keep-a-changing/www.npcompleteheart.com/posts/django-and-mongodb-in-2015"&gt;Django and MongoDB in 2015&lt;/a&gt; 
was prophetic, because I just changed my website over last week. It seemed that everytime I wanted to post 
a blog it was from an IPython notebook, which either meant reconfiguring the site to display IPython notebooks 
and get the css right or keep on with the semi-arduous process of converting the notebook to html (writing 
out `pre` blocks and all that). At this point it made me feel like that barrier was keeping me from blogging. 
Since producing at least a blog per month is on my New Year's resolutions list I decided to change up the 
site to hopefully make it more conducive to me blogging.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Over the past three years I’ve been something of an evangelist for using MongoDB. This stance has
drawn derision from some outside the lab, which frequently forces me to clarify in what
circumstances I think MongoDB (or NoSQL in general) is so great. Unfortunately, I’ve been too lazy
to put those thoughts into writing, so this is my long overdue explanation and the first in a series
of posts describing how I use MongoDB daily.
&lt;/div&gt;

So believe it or not my post from 2013 on setting up a Django website with a MongoDB back-end is still one of my most visited pages. Actually that's not hard to believe, it's not like this site is a trove of content (but it's a goal for 2015 to get content more consistently up here!), but 2013 is more than ancient in technology times so I just wanted to do a quick revisit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I really dislike boilerplate code, it drives me a little bit crazy. Starting database connections falls squarely into that realm. So in the vein of "sharing is caring" here is what I'm currently using with pymongo. It's pretty simple, but why code it twice right?

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/"&gt;Why you should never use MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why does it bother me so much? Mostly because it’s bullshit, but I also feel that NoSQL solutions (and MongoDB specifically) are getting an undue bad reputation due to “MongoDB/NoSQL is bad” articles making great link-bait. Even more than that, people present themselves as experts when in reality they just make extremely broad claims about a lack of suitability without properly defining what their REAL needs are that make a technology so poor. 
&lt;/p&gt;

Some backstory.  I think I first started talking about MongoDB in earnest maybe five months ago in my research lab. After having one person convert with a big project and some successful presentations (which weren't even done by me!) research has finally peaked.  Now that everyone is converting, people are going through the same growing pains I had when I first started. Instead of forgetting these nuggets of information again I wanted to put them done in text.
&lt;/p&gt;

This post is supposed to carry on from &lt;a href="http://www.npcompleteheart.com/post/django-nonrel-mongodb-mongohq-heroku/"&gt; setting up a Django app on Heroku with MongoDB &lt;/a&gt; and help fill in a hole from the MongoDB &lt;a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/write-a-tumblelog-application-with-django-mongodb-engine/"&gt; Tumblelog &lt;/a&gt; tutorial.  The biggest question is, what is my directory structure?  The tutorial jumps around a lot, assuming that you already know where everything should go.  So let's tackle that first.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet do you want to deploy to Heroku and use MongoHQ so there's minimal set up on your end and a free testing sandbox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what I've done with this site (which is why it can be unresponsive also, I'm using all free at the moment).&lt;br&gt;
After doing it once I thought I had it down pat in terms of my online sources and thought that I could replicate 
that success with minimal fuss.  I was just proven wrong when I went too far, too fast and borked my app into a 
state that I didn't know how to fix it out of.  So here is an actual step by step, both for myself and others.&lt;/p&gt;
