So I use Macs (you probably noticed, right? It has unix but it can still connect to any random
projector and still work so it's a winner in academia) and that leads me to using some nonstandard
software every now and then that's OS X only. Keynote is one of those programs. Powerpoint drives me
crazy, so I've been driven into its user-friendly, unshareable arms.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

I spent two years in high school “programming” in C++ on a Windows 98 machine with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; that made the programs run (sometimes) through what must have been magic. The past five years have been a constant refinement of the computational research process for me and I've been wanting to write it all down for awhile now so others could learn from it (for those that are curious, I've learned most of my tricks from blogs written by others). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of points that I want to hit on in the future but for now  I want to focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Creating a standard library&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Record-keeping and on the fly analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A standard library&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started programming libraries were so &lt;strong&gt;damn&lt;/strong&gt; impressive. The capabilities and sheer amount of code obfuscated from me made them seem as monolithic as the programming language itself. After a little while it becomes obvious that libraries put on their coding pants one leg at a time just like we do (spoiler to newbies). What’s the point of this interlude? To convince you to start buidling your own general purpose “library”.&lt;/p&gt;

That's a little bit of a misnomer. I didn't stop checking my email completely. I just started turning on "Do Not Disturb" on my laptop and phone all day. I only look at emails for about two hours every day and it's liberating. I highly suggest trying it.

So, you're working with windows, either by choice (wait. what?) or force (gah, somebody else making computer purchase decisions), and you're a programmer. Not just any programmer, a terminal acolyte that's chosen sides on the great vi/emacs holy war. I'll be blunt, that first sign-on is &lt;strong&gt;painful&lt;/strong&gt;. But hey, the world keeps turning and it's best to stay on top of technology. Here's how I've adjusted, with the all the steps (minus getting vim happy) coming from my Windows trailblazing amigo &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dan_mcclary%E2%80%8E"&gt;Dan McClary&lt;/a&gt;.
