So I use Macs (you probably noticed, right? It has unix but it can still connect to any random
projector and still work so it's a winner in academia) and that leads me to using some nonstandard
software every now and then that's OS X only. Keynote is one of those programs. Powerpoint drives me
crazy, so I've been driven into its user-friendly, unshareable arms.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Most of us use some form of Torque in an academic environment to run scripts on a cluster. Typically I would have some form of script to generate the necessary qsub scripts for submission, but it wasn't ever generic enough. So this has been my working stab at making that happen. 
&lt;/p&gt;

For whatever reason none of the python packages have a function to calculate the Gini coefficient, which is a fairly standard metric for inequality used in economics circles. I wrote this function but I wanted to explain if first.
&lt;/p&gt;

When I worked on metabolism I didn't have any needs to plot data on an actual geographic area (although I always wished some form of coordinate system existed like that for my data). But in my switch to working with health data I now have tons of spatial data. Moreover this spatial component is a fairly important effect on the patterns and behavior that I observe. 
&lt;/p&gt;

I spent two years in high school “programming” in C++ on a Windows 98 machine with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; that made the programs run (sometimes) through what must have been magic. The past five years have been a constant refinement of the computational research process for me and I've been wanting to write it all down for awhile now so others could learn from it (for those that are curious, I've learned most of my tricks from blogs written by others). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of points that I want to hit on in the future but for now  I want to focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Creating a standard library&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Record-keeping and on the fly analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A standard library&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started programming libraries were so &lt;strong&gt;damn&lt;/strong&gt; impressive. The capabilities and sheer amount of code obfuscated from me made them seem as monolithic as the programming language itself. After a little while it becomes obvious that libraries put on their coding pants one leg at a time just like we do (spoiler to newbies). What’s the point of this interlude? To convince you to start buidling your own general purpose “library”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Typically matplotlib produces plots that look, well, horrible. This can be a little bit of a pain, especially because I've switched my workflow to lean heavily on ipython notebook to maintain a lab notebook. This means removing xmgrace from my workflow except for manuscript figure preparation since it won't show up inline unless I make the plot, save it as a png, move the file to the notebook directory, and then link the file in a text section. Not exactly user friendly or an improvement to my workflow. Unfortunately, just because I want to make plots in python for exploration doesn't mean that I can tolerate ugly graphs and that godforsaken default font.
&lt;/p&gt;

I've been working with my friend for awhile now and for the entire length of our project we've struggled to name it.
Over the last week we finally bit the bullet and decided that we would finally name it so other people could start using it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was a struggle. 
&lt;/p&gt;

I really dislike boilerplate code, it drives me a little bit crazy. Starting database connections falls squarely into that realm. So in the vein of "sharing is caring" here is what I'm currently using with pymongo. It's pretty simple, but why code it twice right?
