Despite
having some prior experience with Django I chose Ruby on Rails for two main reasons: (1) it
integrates seamlessly with Heroku, which is an amazing service (for free! at least for my needs)
that provides basic app hosting and is not replicated on the Django side of web development and (2)
it's something I haven't done yet and I would rather learn something new. I'm not a massive fan of
Django, so even though my primary programming experience is in python it didn't deter me from
switching over for this. At a later point, I may detail what I feel are the differences between the
platforms and which one excels in what area, but there's plenty on the web that goes on about the
differences already.&lt;/p&gt;
