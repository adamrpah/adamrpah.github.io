Over the summer I've been able to successfully chisel away at my goal of reading 20 books by 16
different authors in 2015, with my two weeks of travel to and around Spain providing me ample time
to dive into my iPad and digest. For this tour, I went back in time and read Nicholas Christakis'
&lt;strong&gt;Connected&lt;/strong&gt;, which actually provided me with some insight on researchers and topics that I thought I
already knew pretty well. In terms of an overview of how networks affect social phenomena, I would
highly recommend it. I also plowed through Nate Silver's &lt;strong&gt;The Signal and The Noise&lt;/strong&gt;, because I'm
convinced that being acquainted with Nate Silver's work is the litmus test in the public for
understanding data science. It was pretty good, although some of his metaphors were clunky and only
really stuck with me because of reading fivethirtyeight (his own data science news blog) since its
inception.
