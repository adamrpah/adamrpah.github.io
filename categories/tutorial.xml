This was a presentation and sample notebook that I whipped up for the Amaral lab to explain why and some basic hows of using iPython notebooks. This goes along with my previous &lt;a href="http://www.npcompleteheart.com/post/i-wish-i-knew-then-what-i-know-now-reproducible-me/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post and has this &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/anonymous/f8e6d8985d2ea0e4bab1"&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt; to go along with it.

Most of us use some form of Torque in an academic environment to run scripts on a cluster. Typically I would have some form of script to generate the necessary qsub scripts for submission, but it wasn't ever generic enough. So this has been my working stab at making that happen. 
&lt;/p&gt;

For whatever reason none of the python packages have a function to calculate the Gini coefficient, which is a fairly standard metric for inequality used in economics circles. I wrote this function but I wanted to explain if first.
&lt;/p&gt;

When I worked on metabolism I didn't have any needs to plot data on an actual geographic area (although I always wished some form of coordinate system existed like that for my data). But in my switch to working with health data I now have tons of spatial data. Moreover this spatial component is a fairly important effect on the patterns and behavior that I observe. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Typically matplotlib produces plots that look, well, horrible. This can be a little bit of a pain, especially because I've switched my workflow to lean heavily on ipython notebook to maintain a lab notebook. This means removing xmgrace from my workflow except for manuscript figure preparation since it won't show up inline unless I make the plot, save it as a png, move the file to the notebook directory, and then link the file in a text section. Not exactly user friendly or an improvement to my workflow. Unfortunately, just because I want to make plots in python for exploration doesn't mean that I can tolerate ugly graphs and that godforsaken default font.
&lt;/p&gt;

So, you're working with windows, either by choice (wait. what?) or force (gah, somebody else making computer purchase decisions), and you're a programmer. Not just any programmer, a terminal acolyte that's chosen sides on the great vi/emacs holy war. I'll be blunt, that first sign-on is &lt;strong&gt;painful&lt;/strong&gt;. But hey, the world keeps turning and it's best to stay on top of technology. Here's how I've adjusted, with the all the steps (minus getting vim happy) coming from my Windows trailblazing amigo &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dan_mcclary%E2%80%8E"&gt;Dan McClary&lt;/a&gt;.

Some backstory.  I think I first started talking about MongoDB in earnest maybe five months ago in my research lab. After having one person convert with a big project and some successful presentations (which weren't even done by me!) research has finally peaked.  Now that everyone is converting, people are going through the same growing pains I had when I first started. Instead of forgetting these nuggets of information again I wanted to put them done in text.
&lt;/p&gt;

This post is supposed to carry on from &lt;a href="http://www.npcompleteheart.com/post/django-nonrel-mongodb-mongohq-heroku/"&gt; setting up a Django app on Heroku with MongoDB &lt;/a&gt; and help fill in a hole from the MongoDB &lt;a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/write-a-tumblelog-application-with-django-mongodb-engine/"&gt; Tumblelog &lt;/a&gt; tutorial.  The biggest question is, what is my directory structure?  The tutorial jumps around a lot, assuming that you already know where everything should go.  So let's tackle that first.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet do you want to deploy to Heroku and use MongoHQ so there's minimal set up on your end and a free testing sandbox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what I've done with this site (which is why it can be unresponsive also, I'm using all free at the moment).&lt;br&gt;
After doing it once I thought I had it down pat in terms of my online sources and thought that I could replicate 
that success with minimal fuss.  I was just proven wrong when I went too far, too fast and borked my app into a 
state that I didn't know how to fix it out of.  So here is an actual step by step, both for myself and others.&lt;/p&gt;

be helpful to others.&lt;/p&gt;
