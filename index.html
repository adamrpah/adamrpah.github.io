<p>Well, not for me of course. After a solid week of my girlfriend helping me to use Illustrator it was
time to pay her back and help her get a website up and running. I went over the options that I knew
(Nikola, Django, Node.js, Ruby on Rails) and it became quickly apparent that none of those were
options that she liked. Instead she wanted to take a wordpress site that she made in a class and add
some more to it/fix it up. The only logistical issue is that it's hard to find a wordpress host for
free that allows you to use a custom domain (she's about to graduate from school so it's important
that she have a real website name). For that privilege wordpress.org charges you $8/mon, which,
while I may know nothing about Wordpress, I find to be crazy.</p>
<p>So instead I went around searching for how to shoehorn Wordpress onto Heroku's Cedar stack (which is
where Django ends up). Luckily others have already had this desire and it was super easy!  Using
this <a href="https://github.com/mhoofman/wordpress-heroku">github</a> repository and README I had the
wordpress site up and running in seconds. Woot!</p>

<p>I guess my post on (Django and MongoDB in 2015)[www.npcompleteheart.com/posts/django-and-mongodb-in-2015] 
was prophetic, because I just changed my website over last week. It seemed that everytime I wanted to post 
a blog it was from an IPython notebook, which either meant reconfiguring the site to display IPython notebooks 
and get the css right or keep on with the semi-arduous process of converting the notebook to html (writing 
out <code>pre</code> blocks and all that). At this point it made me feel like that barrier was keeping me from blogging. 
Since producing at least a blog per month is on my New Year's resolutions list I decided to change up the 
site to hopefully make it more conducive to me blogging.</p>

<p>This week I had the, almost obscene, pleasure of participating in Northwestern’s Computational
Research Day as a chairperson and poster judge.I typically cringe at the thought of attending
conferences and symposia, since I am mainly a homebody (I love my desk, computer, research, and
daily schedule), but at the symposium on Tuesday I felt constantly excited and engaged. The variety
and quality of research presented was excellent and the diverse topics covered kept the gears
turning in my head.</p>

<p>Over the past three years I’ve been something of an evangelist for using MongoDB. This stance has
drawn derision from some outside the lab, which frequently forces me to clarify in what
circumstances I think MongoDB (or NoSQL in general) is so great. Unfortunately, I’ve been too lazy
to put those thoughts into writing, so this is my long overdue explanation and the first in a series
of posts describing how I use MongoDB daily.</p>

I just finished reading Axelrod's <i>The Complexity of Cooperation</i> and I have to say, it's one of the better scientific books that I can remember reading (period). This is surprising (for me), since it's really just a collection of seven of his published papers along with some commentary. However, his papers are so well written and the commentary is brilliant, especially for someone pursuing research as a career, since it not only provides insight into the genesis of the work but also how it was regarded by journals.
</p>

<p>
This case is especially so for Chapters 4/5/7, which are concerned with his use of Landscape theory to predict alliances between nations and companies and the diffusion of culture. For all of these papers, he discusses the difficulties in publishing these pieces and then their lack of acceptance in the field at the time. For the landscape theories the lack of acceptance was primarily due to the nonexistence of rational agents and decision-making, while in the culture diffusion model it centered on the absence of "politics of any kind", as so succinctly stated by one reviewer.

So believe it or not my post from 2013 on setting up a Django website with a MongoDB back-end is still one of my most visited pages. Actually that's not hard to believe, it's not like this site is a trove of content (but it's a goal for 2015 to get content more consistently up here!), but 2013 is more than ancient in technology times so I just wanted to do a quick revisit.

<h5>Should I follow that blog post and set up a Django app with MongoDB?</h5>

<h5>Hell no, definitely not now</h5>

Twenty fourteen, what can I say. It was consistent and not always pretty but I made it through. I made my first actual contribution to an <a href="http://github.com/python-visualization/folium/commits?author=adamrpah">open source project</a>, learned the value of gists, started opening up <a href="http://github.com/adamrpah/GALE">GALE</a> to the world, and successfully made it through putting on a one week bootcamp transform non-coders into pythonistas. I at least got one manuscript out (albeit a <a href="http://npcompleteheart.com/article/big-data-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-card/">review</a>) and a conference presentation at <a href="http://npcompleteheart.com/article/unzipping-zip-codes-a-methodology-to-assign-de-ide/">AMIA</a>. I even launched Socraticc as a part of OmegaK and brought it right down after no one wanted to use it after a few months.

What will I make for dinner? A relatively simple question that plagues me most nights of the week. However, what is a relatively simple task, albeit one that can be arduous for me, unpacks a can of worms in basic research: through what <b>mental process</b> do I decide what to make?
</p>

<p>
Admittedly this is a silly question, but other questions used to motivate this issue are roughly as silly. The point is merely to illuminate the difference between decision-making paradigms. Classically, or as far as my knowledge extends to, we would typically think of solving this problem through maximizing our utility, searching for the best possible answer (the global optima). In the context of our dinner problem, the steps to solving our problem would look like:
</p>
<ol>
<li>mentally assemble all of the possible recipes</li>
<li>determine which recipes had all of the possible recipes</li>
<li>determine which recipes had all available ingredients</li>
<li>account for the spoilage dates of all the ingredients</li>
<li>identify the meal that would provide the maximum utility (one that uses the most ingredients that are about to spoil the soonest while being feasible to make)</li> 
</ol>
