'Contagion' is a powerful model for social processes, one that simultaneously highlights the complexity of a group's aggregate behavior over time and provides a simple, straightforward explanation for how that behavior would arise.  
The concept of contagion and its expression is a relatively slippery one though, since it is
effectively being ported from biology. While there was a long time before we
truly understood this process in biology (research done/hypotheses prior to the proposal of germ theory), it was even longer until we could identify and measure the incidence of a disease and track its spread.
